Slide Roulette to play within your team.

Vanilla js implementation of a slide roulette game. Slide Roulette is a non-competitive game to practice public speaking, thinking on your feet, and improvisation.

## The Game

- Take a random image. 
- Tell a story about it for a few seconds. The longer the time, the harder it is.
- You can make the story up. You can tell a story from memory. It's up to you.
- Try starting with 10 seconds and upping the time if you find it too easy.

## How to play?
